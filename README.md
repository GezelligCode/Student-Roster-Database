# Student-Roster-Database

This is the first C++ project that I've created, pursuant to my CS degree at WGU. I completed everything independently through my own research and studying,
and as much as I pulled my hair out at times after running into wall after wall, I found the exercise thoroughly satisfying as I successfully solved problem after problem. 
I submitted the project and received 100% on each evaluation criteria. :)
